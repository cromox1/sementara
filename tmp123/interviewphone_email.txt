Hi Rosli,

 
Further to our conversation I can confirm your phone interview with Passiv Systems for 
Tuesday 15th January at 10:15. Kevin Stewart, QA Manager, will call you on your mobile.

Before the interview please review the job spec and the company website. This research 
is vital as they will ask what you know about the company. 

Kevin will go through the spec and CV. He will be asking you to give examples of things 
you mention on your CV. In addition he will ask about your greatest technical challenges, 
how you overcame them, how you have automated processes, when and how you last learnt a 
new skill, how you keep up to date with technology, what motivates you, etc.

He will also ask specific questions and ask for examples regarding testing (automated 
and manual). These questions will relate to both product knowledge and approach to 
testing and problem solving.

The phone interview will last 45 minute.

If you have any questions please let me know. Alternatively I look forward to your 
feedback after the interview.

Thanks,

James
